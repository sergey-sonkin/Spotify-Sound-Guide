# Spotify-Sound-Guide

The goal of this project is to simulate the experience of sitting with your best friend on the couch as they introduce you to their favorite artist.

Accomplished so far:
- Ingesting song feature data from Spotify API
- Transforming song features
- Defining metric for recommendability of a song
- Suggesting songs by recommendability, prompting user for whether they enjoyed a song

In progress:
- Creating an alternative to Spotify's missing popularity metric 
- Additional song filtering (i.e interludes)
- Storing song information in a local database to avoid duplicate lookups

Goals down the road:
- Adding a web-based frontend with Flask
- Additional metadata: cross referencing YTMusicAPI for lyric and genre data
